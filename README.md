Guessing Number Game in C 🎮

Overview
This project is a simple guessing number game implemented in C, developed as part of my internship at Pinnacle Labs. The game prompts the player to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range and provides feedback on each guess until the correct number is guessed.

Features
Random Number Generation: 🎲 The game uses the rand() function to generate a random number between a specified range.
User Input Handling: 🖥️ Implemented robust user input handling to ensure the game responds appropriately to various input scenarios.
Game Loop: 🔁 Utilized loops to manage the flow of the game, allowing the player to make multiple guesses until they guess correctly.
Feedback Mechanism: 📝 Provided clear feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
Learning Outcomes
This project helped me strengthen my understanding and proficiency in:

C programming fundamentals, including variables, loops, functions, and conditional statements.
Algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills, particularly in designing the game logic.
Debugging and error handling techniques to ensure the game operates smoothly under different scenarios.
Future Improvements
While the current version of the game is functional, future enhancements could include:

-Implementing a scoring system to track the number of attempts taken by the player.
-Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience.
-Refactoring the code to improve readability and maintainability.

Conclusion
Developing this guessing number game was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical project. I am grateful for the opportunity provided by Pinnacle Labs to work on this project and look forward to leveraging these skills in future software development endeavors.
